# Volatility Forecasting with GARCH Model

This project uses Python and the GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model to analyze and forecast the volatility of a stock based on historical price data.

## Data

Historical stock price data was used, including columns: Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, and Volume.

## Tools Used

- Python
- `arch` package for GARCH modeling
- Matplotlib for visualization
- Pandas for data handling

## Objective

To estimate and visualize conditional volatility in stock returns using a GARCH(1,1) model.

## Output

A chart showing the predicted volatility over time.

## What I Learned

- Basics of time-series volatility modeling
- Hands-on experience with Python for financial analysis
- How to preprocess and clean financial data for modeling
